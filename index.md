# Predicting Avalanche Incidents in Colorado
Every year, approximately 27 people die from an avalanche in the United States, with hundreds more being non-fatally buried and likely many going unreported. In regions that pose high risks of avalanches, this threat is more prevalent than any other natural event. If we could analyze the conditions that lead up to an avalanche occurrence, we can attempt to predict regions where an avalanche is imminent and issue warnings before another incident takes place.
